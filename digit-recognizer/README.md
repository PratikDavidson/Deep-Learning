# Kaggle - Digit Recognizer

Goal - To study three models performance in computer vision problem (Digit Recognizer).


## Digit Recognizer

- Digit Recognizer is based on identifying handwritten digits from the "Hello World!" dataset in computer vision (MNIST).


## Models

- Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) - Achieved 95-96% score
- 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) - Achived 96-97% score
- 2D-Convoluntional Neural Network (2D-CNN) - Achieved 99% score



## Result

- 2D-CNN performed far better in comparision to other two models with least learning parameters whereas 1D-CNN though performed a little bit better than FCNN but the overall advantage was less learning parameters compared to FCNN.
