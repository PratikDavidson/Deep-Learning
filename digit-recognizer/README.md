##Deep-Learning

#Kaggle - Digit Recognizer

This repo contains three models:

1. Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) - Achieved 95-96% score 
2. 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) - Achived 96-97% score
3. 2D-Convoluntional Neural Network (2D-CNN) - Achieved 99% score

**Goal**: To check the above three models performance in computer vision problem.
**Result**: 2D-CNN performed far better in comparision to other two models with least learning parameters whereas 1D-CNN though performed a little bit better than FCNN but the overall advantage was less learning parameters compared to FCNN.
